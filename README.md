The project i will be building uses the Nasa.gov api, i will get videos and images of space from the mars rover as well as the satellites and asteroid and planetary information.
I could not find any websites or applications that help convey my concept and functionality. I will be hitting a few different apis within nasa.gov to access additional information

The functional components will consist of a Header, Footer, Main, videolist, imagelist, asteroidlist

i will have three scrollable bars of images videos and text when the images are clicked theyll will pop up and extend out with descriptive text.
the videos will be able to play within the sliding bars. and the asteroid info will be on another page where user can search data based on input


will also have a page that shows the APOD.. Astronomy picture of the day upon clicking a button, theres is a date parameter so potentially i will be able to use a click event to call random photos
